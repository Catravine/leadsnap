# Ruby on Rails Capstone Project:
LeadSnap: Simple Performing Arts Telemarketing Firm Lead Management Application

### About the Client: TeleUnique McQnications

TeleUnique is a small Performing Arts telemarketing firm located in Indianpolis, IN and in operation since 1990.  It has employed anywhere from 20 to 70 people (salespersons, or 'telethugs') at any given time, but for past 5 years has been around 20 - 30.  

Incredibly, it has managed to persist the 'old fashioned way', with people dialing phones and contacting leads from printed lists.  There is some sense in eschewing the auto-dialing part of more 'moderized' firms.  Better engagement, more control over callbacks, etc.  

However dealing with all the leads 'on paper' creates a ton of uneccessary ineficiency.  Finding a lead when someone calls back in, marking disconnected numbers and striking them from the lead pool, keeping track of callbacks, etc.  

The goal of this project is to create a simple lead management system.  Other systems available  tie in with an autodialer which we do not want. They also tend to provide a bunch of extra 'marketing research', about which leads are allegedly the best.  Since this is a list of current customers to begin with, any other 'profiling' of the leads is unneccessary, and potentially determental.  Other sofware available also requires a manager or admin to switch people's list over if they want to call a different project and we want to make access for whatever callers want to work on simple.

### What we DO want:

Call lists should be able to be fed into the program to be managed.  They should be separated by campaign, and further distinction by what type of buyer they are.  (Single ticket classical, lapsed pops series subscriber, etc)

Callers to be able to log in, choose which campaign and type of leads they want to call, and access the leads that are available and be provided with ones that have been dialed least recently.  They should also be able to set callbacks and store that info.  They should be able to mark numbers as disconnected or incorrect, or be able to remove customers from the list that request it.   

Managers should be able to search the database of leads to find someone quickly if needed, and see who they talked to last if applicable, or if its someone's callback for instance.
