#Architectural Decision Record

###2016-04-19
Decided to to try to make my own admin for users and see how that goes.  
`Administrate` is cool, but I learned more about it, and customizing its views 
doesn't work. Its good for basic CRUD and not a lot else customization-wise.  
As the (relatively recent) GoRails screen cast about it says, it has potential
but isn't quite there yet in terms of customization.

Using `administrate` for admin dashboards.  Charlie suggested it and it seems
to do just what I need, although it could use some graphical customization.
very easy to customize data though.

###2016-04-16
Using `devise` for user authentication, rather than "from scratch".  Pre-planning is done, about to 'break ground' on some code.
